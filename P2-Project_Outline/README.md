### OVERVIEW

A few years ago, my God daughter, Nadia, had a medical emergencey after she ate dinner at a new restaurant. She ate a meal that contained nuts
to which she was allergic. I began to wonder if there were any type of apps that could have alerted Nadia that the restaurant did not
have dishes without nuts. Therefore, my project is to create an app, AllergenAlerts, that allows the user to select an allergen from a drop down list of the most common
allergens, then receive a listing of restaurants that serve meals without the chosen allergen. The user will have the
opportunity to select a restaurant which will display its name, address, phone number, and location/map.

###FEATURES

Drop Down/Select: Users will be able to pick an allergen from a drop down list of most common allergens.

Search/Sort: A database search will take place and retrieve information about restaurants that have a flag for not containing allergen.

Listing: Users will receive a listings of restaurants from a database search based upon the allergen selected.
