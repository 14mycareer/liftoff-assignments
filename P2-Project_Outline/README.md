## Submission Instructions

### Overview
A few years ago, my God daughter, Nadia,had a medical emergencey after she ate dinner at a new restaurant. She ate a meal that contained nuts
to which she was allergic. I began to wonder if there were any type of apps that could have alerted Nadia that the restaurant did not
have dishes without nuts. Therefore, my project is to create an app that allows the user to select from a drop down list of the most common
allergens. The app, AllergenAlerts, will then provide a listing of restaurants that serve meals without the chosen allergen. The user will have the
opportunity to select a restaurant which will display its name, address,phone number, and location/map.
