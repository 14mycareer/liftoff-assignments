### Overview
A few years ago, my God daughter, Nadia,had a medical emergencey after she ate dinner at a new restaurant. She ate a meal that contained nuts
to which she was allergic. I began to wonder if there were any type of apps that could have alerted Nadia that the restaurant did not
have dishes without nuts.
